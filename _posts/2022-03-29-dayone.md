In class questions:
-Post vs. Get

Takeaways:
-Don't use CRUD operations in URL (same names won't conflict because of the verb)
-Shortcuts in the controller include dropping .html.erb, "template", if name of folder matches name of folder you can drop it (i.e. render("new") to create a new movie)
-Resources method (i.e. resources:director) in the routes will create the Golden 7 actions
